  documentTitle: wrong
  documentText: "The sudden lack of their presence `0`on billboards or commercials
    passed`/` over my head, but when I arrived to `0`work after my week of wallowing`/`
    and found my assignment was some up-and -coming B-grade actress and not the snarky
    trickster `3`comedian`/` I\u2019d been practically tied to for the past five
    years, I was dumbfounded.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat about `1`chief?\u201D`/` I asked
    `0`boss\u2019s name.`/`\r\n\r\n`0`She`/` just raised an impatient eyebrow at
    me, \u201CWhat? `1`Chief`/` who? Were you so sick you\u2019ve been hallucinating,
    huh?\u201D \r\n\r\nThe rest of the day was a daze as I desperately searched for
    a memory of proof of their existence `0`in the city, only to come up with`/`
    nothing. Their `2`entire legacy`/`, erased. When I returned home from /my post/
    I scoured the internet for solace, but it was like chasing a ghost. There was
    no trace that they had `0`existed at all`/` let alone been `0`in the public sphere.`/`\r\n\r\nI
    couldn\u2019t keep the panic from rising in me. `0`It felt as though I lost my`/`
    grip on reality, I didn\u2019t know `0`what was`/` real `0`and what was`/` fake.
    Next thing I knew I was screaming, overwhelmed with a distinct feeling of `2`wrongness
    and despair. That this was not as it should be, but more than that, this is not
    how it had been. That something was fundamentally wrong with the reality I was
    living.`/`\r\n\r\nFor some reason or another, as I lay on my clean, carpeted
    floor, staring dully at the ceiling, my mind settled on a certain answer. In
    any other circumstances, it would have been ridiculous, but at that point, `0`I
    had nothing left to lose. I had to accept the possibility that Chief was, and
    had`/` never `2`quite been, a `/` human being.\r\n"
