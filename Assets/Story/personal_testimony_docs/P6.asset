  documentText: "After spending so much time with them, I should have known that
    this was all their fault.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not just `0`them and their accompanying
    memories`/` that seem to be forgotten, but their entire identity, life, legacy
    purposefully erased. \r\n\r\nAny records I find connected to them are corrupted
    pieces of junk, or almost completely blacked out, as if `0`somebodys gone back
    and redacted all proof of their existence.`/` \r\n\r\nOr maybe they were always
    like that. Maybe they\u2019d been covering their tracks early on, preparing for
    something like this. For someone like me to catch a drift, stick their nose where
    it doesn't belong. It\u2019s driving me mad that at this rate, `2`I\u2019ll never
    know for sure what happened to them, and why their nonexistence seems to have
    saved the world.`/`\r\n"
