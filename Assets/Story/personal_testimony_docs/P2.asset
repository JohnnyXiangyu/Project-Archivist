  documentText: "It\u2019s as if I've `2`lived a different life`/` than everyone
    else on the planet. There has not been a single report, news broadcast, or even
    a passing conversation on the street about `1`this sudden restoration.`/` I don\u2019t
    know what to make of it. My dread only grows each passing day. I can\u2019t help
    but think, `0` am I the only`/` one who remembers?\r\n\r\nThe back to back calamities,
    the`0` ever mounting casualties, the very fabric`/` of society coming undone.
    I would almost prefer to have things back to `0`the way they were`/`, rather
    than this uncanny fever dream I seem to be living in. Day in and day out, nothing
    but peace and mundanity, yet I find myself incapable of relaxing.\r\n\r\nI have
    noticed one difference. They seem to have `2`disappeared.`/` \r\n"
