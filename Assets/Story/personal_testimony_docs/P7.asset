  documentText: "The thought struck me today that the information I\u2019m gathering
    might be useless in the grand scheme of things. The chances of them coming back,
    of me finding actual concrete answers, seem slim to none. Some part of me acknowledges,
    of course, `0`that if their absence is all that's required to equivocally save
    the world, then it's`/` a small price to pay. \r\n\r\nYet, I still want to try
    and understand.\r\n\r\nAnother part of me writhes with anger and frustration
    over my inability to preserve their legacy\u2013to preserve them\u2013in any
    way more concrete than\u2026 this. Surely not every impact they had here in `3`the
    mortal realm`/` was inherently bad; something that ricocheted into our demise.
    I know that cannot be. I myself am living `0`proof`/` that it cannot be. \r\n\r\nWhat
    I\u2019m doing is selfish. It won\u2019t change things. But it\u2019s also something
    I need to do, if I\u2019m ever going to rest easy in this world they created
    for me.\r\n\r\n"
