  documentTitle: discovery
  documentText: "I woke up today in my apa`0`rtment of six y`/`ears ago. No crumbing
    walls, no busted pipes, no emergency rations or home-made wine in the pantry.
    Pristine dry wall, a smoothly running shower, a fridge stocked with fresh produce.
    `1`My mother,`/` alive.\r\n\r\nI threw up in my now pearl white toilet.\r\n\r\nNever
    had I felt so disoriented and unstable in my life. I thought for sure I was dreaming,
    but the bitter taste of bile in my mouth was all too real. \r\n\r\nSticking my
    head outside,  I saw the world around me as suddenly unbroken as my home. It
    would have been nostalgic had it not been so profoundly disturbing. \r\n\r\nI
    got a call from `0`the agency after I failed to show up fo`/`r my assignment.
    On their end, it was as if nothing had happened. \r\n\r\nAs if `0`this untouched`/`
    world was the norm. \r\n\r\nI felt the pit in my stomach deepen when `0`boss's
    name`/` scolded me for not showing up instead of screaming in confusion about
    the `1`seemingly overnight restoration of `/` humanity.\r\n\r\nIn the end I called
    out sick and got away with a slap on the wrist and `0`a week off`/`. I\u2019m
    no use like this, after all. `0`A week`/` to get my head on straight. And `3`figure
    out what`/` the hell has happened.\r\n"
