  documentText: "I had always been somewhat aware of the `2`supernatural presence
    coexisting with our world.`/` , beyond the mythology surrounding it. My `0`sister`/`
    used to say that our `2`family`/` had a connection to `1`an unseen world`/`,
    but whenever I asked `0`her`/` what that meant, `0`she would`/` just shake `0`her`/`
    head and say, \u201CYou\u2019ll know it when you feel it, pipsqueak.\u201D\r\n\r\nI
    felt it when I was around `3`Chief`/`. \r\n\r\nThe first time I met them was
    an unsettling experience. It had been a formal meeting, to set up our contract.
    They had been lounging in an armchair, looking like a lazy cat until `4`I stepped
    in and their eyes caught mine.`/`\r\n\r\nI immediately felt the presence of something
    `1`more powerful than this world`/` in their soul. The feeling caught me off
    guard, and their idleness turned to interest as a slow, almost bemused smile
    lit up their face.\r\n\r\n\u201CSo you\u2019re the new muscle for hire, eh?\u201D\r\n\r\nFor
    a while, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to confront them about it, but I couldn\u2019t
    shake that `2`uncanny feeling I had whenever I was around them, telling me that
    the person next to me was in fact not a person -no regular celebrity- but a thing,
    a being - that held a power so immense that it nearly swept me off my feet.`/`\r\n"
