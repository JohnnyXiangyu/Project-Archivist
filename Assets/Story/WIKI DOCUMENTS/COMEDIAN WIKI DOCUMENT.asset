  documentText: ">> Comedy performance dates back to antiquity (425 BC), during a
    time where most notably, comic author and playwright Aristophanes wrote 40 ancient
    comedic plays, 11 of which survived and are still being performed. Comedy as
    a genre is quintessential to Ancient Greek dramatic genres, the others being
    tragedy and the satyr plays.\r\n\r\n>> Among the works of English poet and playwright
    William Shakespeare, are many comedies which are now considered \u201CShakespearean
    comedies\u201D that are characterized by a happy ending, usually involving marriages
    between the unmarried characters, and a tone and style that is more light-hearted
    than Shakespeare's other plays. \r\n \r\n>> In the modern era, standup comedy
    has its roots in the United Kingdom in 1850 music hall theatres. American standup
    emerged in the corresponding vaudeville theatre from the 1880s to the 1930s."
